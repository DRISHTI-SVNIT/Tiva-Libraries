LCD PIN OUT-

1.VSS-connect it to GND
2.VDD-connect it to 5V
3.VEE-connect it to GND
4.RS-connect it to Q4
5.R/W-connect it to GND
6.ENABLE-connect it to GPIO_PIN_0 (PORTB)
D0,D1,D2,D3-no connection
11.D4-connect it to Q0
12.D5-connect it to Q1
13.D6-connect it to Q2
14.D7-connect it to Q3
=====================================================================================================
74HC595 PIN OUT-

SH_CP and ST_CP-short both the pins and connect them through CLOCK pin (GPIO_PIN_5)(PORTB)
DS-connect it to DATA pin(GPIO_PIN_1)(PORTB)
MR-connect it to 5V
OE-connect it to GND

first connect ENABLE,CLOCK AND DATA pins to LLC then to tiva

FUNCTIONING OF LCD->
Pin description-
Vss-GND 
VDD-5V
VEE-contrast pin-its voltage can be varied using potentiometer,bt we can also connect it to GND
RS-register select pin
this pin is used to give commands and data to the LCD
RS=1 //data register
RS=0 //command register
R/W-read/write pin,used to read and write on LCD
R/W=1//read from LCD
R/W=0//write on LCD
ENABLE= This is a edge triggering signal which is used while writing or reading data to/from LCD respectively.
E = high to low / negative edge triggered -> Write
E = low to high / positive edge triggered -> Read
D0,D1,D2,D3,D4,D5,D6,D7-DATA PINS of LCD 
D7-it is the busy flag pin of LCD.We have to configure D7 pin as input while checking the flag condition.And along with this we have to
make RS=0 and R/W=1.Since this is the read operation and busy flag is given by command code register mode.
Busy flag=1 =>LCD is busy
Busy flag=0 =>LCD can take next data or command.
15th and 16th pin of LCD ->backlight pins
15th=Vcc and 16th=GND


FEW BASIC COMMANDS OF LCD ->
///// 4 pin initialization
LcdCommandWrite(0x03); // function set:
// 4 pin initialization
delay(64);
LcdCommandWrite(0x03); // function set:
// 4 pin initialization
delay(50);
LcdCommandWrite(0x03); // function set:
// 4 pin initialization
delay(50);
LcdCommandWrite(0x02); // function set:
// 4 pin initialization
delay(50);
LcdCommandWrite(0x2C); // function set:
// 4-bit interface, 1 display lines, 5x7 font
////// end of 4 pin initialization 
delay(20);
LcdCommandWrite(0x06); // entry mode set:
// increment automatically, no display shift
delay(20);
LcdCommandWrite(0x0E); // display control:
// turn display on, cursor on, no blinking
delay(20);
LcdCommandWrite(0x01); // clear display, set cursor position to zero
delay(100);
LcdCommandWrite(0x80); // display control:(To start the cursor from beginning)
delay(20);
///// unter this line are the special stuff you don't need for a initialitzation
LcdCommandWrite(0x0F); //  cursor blink
delay(10);
}


========================================================================================================
now brief description of the functions used in lcd library-
1.void LCD_16x2_595_init()-this function set 3 pins-enable,clock and data as output pins and initially their value is zero
and also some commands are being sent to LCD like 0x03 for 4 pin initialization,etc.

2.void Lcd_595_Cmd(unsigned char c)-this function is used to send command to LCD .In this we are sending 8 bit data to
 4 data pins of LCD by diving the 8 bit data in 2 parts and assigning them to upper nibble and lower nibble and then sends 
the data bitwise using shiftOut function. 

3.void Lcd_595_send_character(unsigned char c)-this function is used to send character to the LCD using shift operator.

4.void PulseEnable ()-First make enable pin high and then after some delay ,make enable pin low.This is done so that the 
LCD can get enough time to gather the information(or for processing).

5.void shiftOut(unsigned char c)-sending data bit wise.

6.void send_number(unsigned long n)-used to print number on LCD

7.void sendAstring(char *ch)-used to print string on LCD in both lines

8.void sendF_number(double n)-used to print decimal number

9.void LCD_Print( char* format,...)-through this printf function , u can print integer,float,string and character

10.void Lcd_595_Chr(char row, char column, char out_char)-set position which is being sent to function and print character

11.void Lcd_595_text(char row, char column, char *text)-set position which is being sent to function and print string

12.void start_from_beginning()-if data overflows then use this function

13.void Position_Lcd(unsigned char x, unsigned char y)-set the desired position in LCD
